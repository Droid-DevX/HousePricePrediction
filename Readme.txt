Real Estate Value Predictor

A Machine Learning–powered web application for predicting house prices using Linear Regression and advanced feature engineering techniques. The project includes a fully interactive Streamlit interface with authentication, custom UI design, and visual data representation.

Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for building, training, and deploying a regression-based machine learning model.
The system predicts real estate property values based on several structural and numerical features extracted from the Ames Housing dataset.

The deployed Streamlit application allows users to input property characteristics and receive an estimated house price generated by the trained model.

Features

Predicts real estate prices using a trained Linear Regression model.

Includes feature scaling (Standardization) and one-hot encoding.

Incorporates correlation-based feature selection.

Custom Streamlit user interface with authentication.

Real-time prediction output with input summary.

How the System Works

User inputs house attributes such as:

Overall Quality

Living Area

Garage Capacity

Number of Bathrooms

Year Built

The system constructs a complete feature vector using columns.pkl.

The vector is processed using the saved StandardScaler.

The trained model generates a prediction (log scale → converted back to actual price).

The application displays:

Estimated price

Selected feature summary table

Pie chart showing distribution of input values

Quick metric overview

Example Output

Input Example

Overall Quality: 7

Living Area: 2200 sq ft

Garage Cars: 2

Full Bathrooms: 2

Year Built: 2003

Predicted Output

Estimated Price: ₹ 24,580,000

Future Enhancements

Integration of additional models (Random Forest, XGBoost).

Deployment on Streamlit Cloud or HuggingFace Spaces.

Database integration for storing historical predictions.

Addition of confidence intervals for predictions.

Support for more input features and automated feature selection.
